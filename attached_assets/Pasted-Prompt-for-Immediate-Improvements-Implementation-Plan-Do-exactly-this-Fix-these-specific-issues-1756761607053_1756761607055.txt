Implementation Plan (Do exactly this):

Fix these specific issues in my NutriScan AI app.  Only enhance existing features:
PRIORITY FIXES (implement in order):

1:
 * In script.js, locate the JavaScript code that handles clicks on #loginBtn and #signupBtn. (If none create for both) 
 ...Modify the click handlers for both buttons to perform the following sequence:
   ...Display the message: "Full login access coming soon. Redirecting to guest mode." in the #authMessage element.
   ...After a 1.5-second delay, programmatically click the #guestBtn button to trigger the existing guest mode logic. This will set the localStorage item and redirect the user.
 ...ensure the existing Continue as Guest button (#guestBtn) functionality remains unchanged, as it is already working



2. CHECKBOX SIZE REDUCTION:
In style.css, make checkboxes smaller:
.item-checkbox input[type="checkbox"] {
  width: 0.9rem;
  height: 0.9rem;
  cursor: pointer;
}

3. FIX SERVICE WORKER REGISTRATION:
In script.js, change the service worker registration line to:
navigator.serviceWorker.register('./sw.js')

4. ADD MISSING HTML ELEMENTS:
The dashboard.html is missing elements that JavaScript references. Add these sections:

- Import Data Modal (the JavaScript references importDataModal but HTML is missing)
- Notification Settings section (JavaScript looks for notification-settings)
- Complete Analytics section with proper IDs

5. IMPROVE MOBILE TOUCH TARGETS:
Ensure all interactive elements are minimum 44px for mobile accessibility.

6. ENHANCE ERROR HANDLING:
Add better user feedback for failed operations with specific error messages.

7. FIX BULK SELECTION LOGIC:
The "Select All" checkbox doesn't properly sync with individual selections. Fix the state management.

IMPLEMENTATION RULES:
- Keep vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript structure
- No external APIs or services
- No backend requirements
- Focus on polish and user experience
- Test each change before proceeding

Start with item 1 and work through the list.
